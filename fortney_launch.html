      <h1>Building Fortney Design Co: Lessons Learned from Launching My Freelance Web Design Site</h1>

      <p>When I set out to build the Fortney Design Co website, I knew I wanted it to do more than just show off some flashy layouts. It had to reflect who I am, how I work, and what I deliver. This wasn’t my first build, but it <em>was</em> the first time I was designing a site to represent myself and my business. That made it personal. And that made it matter.</p>

      <h2>Starting with Identity</h2>
      <p>Before writing a single line of code, I had to nail down my brand. After some brainstorming (and a few dozen logo drafts), I landed on the name <strong>Fortney Design Co</strong>. It felt clean, professional, and rooted. It is the kind of name you could trust with a big idea. From there, I created a monogram logo and paired it with a simple, bold text mark. The color scheme centered around a cyan accent to bring in a fresh, modern energy without overcomplicating the palette.</p>

      <h2>The Build</h2>
      <p>The site was hand‑coded using HTML and CSS and hosted on GitHub Pages, a platform I’ve grown comfortable with for fast, reliable deployment. I created a responsive layout that showcases three core service tiers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Site Sprint</strong> - fast‑turnaround, no‑fluff web builds</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Bundle</strong> - a more in‑depth offering, combining web and brand growth tools</li>
        <li><strong>Season‑Long Care</strong> - monthly maintenance for clients who want ongoing support</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each offering has its own tone, but they all stick to one core promise: clean, functional websites that get results.</p>

      <h2>Design Choices that Made a Difference</h2>
      <p>One big lesson was that <em>visual hierarchy matters more than you think</em>. I iterated on the hero section several times, resizing logos, adjusting spacing, and refining tagline font sizes until it hit that sweet spot where everything just <em>clicked</em>. Another was making sure the hamburger menu sat just right on mobile. Tiny details like padding on mobile headers? They make a big difference in how professional a site feels.</p>
      <p>I also included direct CTAs like a <strong>Book a Free Discovery Call</strong> button linked to Calendly and set up the contact section to connect directly to <a href="mailto:sales@fortneydesignco.com">sales@fortneydesignco.com</a>. Every piece had to serve a purpose, not just take up space.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency builds trust.</strong> From logo placement to color use, keeping things consistent across the site made the experience feel polished.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity wins.</strong> I avoided overloading the site with animations or unnecessary extras. Clean design and fast load times trump complexity every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Iteration is the secret weapon.</strong> Almost nothing stayed the same from my first draft, and that’s a good thing. Iterating quickly (and often) made the site sharper with each pass.</li>
        <li><strong>It’s never really done.</strong> Even after launch, I’m tweaking copy, refining design, and keeping everything optimized for mobile.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What’s Next</h2>
      <p>Now that the site’s live, I’m turning my attention toward outreach, building a client base, and expanding service offerings. I’m also teaming up with my sister, who’s a social media consultant, to offer bundled branding and content packages. Together, we’re aiming to help businesses not only <em>launch</em>, but <em>grow</em> online.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Launching the Fortney Design Co website was more than a portfolio exercise; it was a commitment to my own business. It’s a starting line, not a finish line. And with every client project I take on, I’ll bring this same level of care, clarity, and clean execution to the table.</p>
      <p>If you’re a small business, startup, or creative looking to make your mark online, let’s build something that works and wins.</p>
